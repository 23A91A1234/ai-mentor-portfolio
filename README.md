```
```markdown
## Day 1 — Setup complete

- ✅ Google AI Studio API key provisioned
- ✅ Groq API key provisioned
- ✅ Hello-Gemini call working — see [Day1_Setup.ipynb](Day1_Setup.ipynb)
- 4-tool comparison matrix from Lab 1A: see screenshot below

## Day 2 Lab 2B — Errors handled

1. **Markdown fence wrapping** (`\`\`\`json ... \`\`\``)
   The retry prompt asks Gemini to output raw JSON without fences. Triggers on ~5-10% of calls.

2. **Hallucinated phone number when source has none**
   `Optional[str] = None` in Pydantic — model returns `null`, schema validates.

3. **Empty / whitespace-only input**
   Pydantic raises ValidationError with "Field required". Caller catches.

## Sample résumés processed: 3 / 3 successful

## Day 5 — Résumé Scorer Streamlit

**Live URL:** https://ai-mentor-portfolio-ei4a6wqknxhjyy3n2mkl4f.streamlit.app/
**Code:** [app.py](app.py)
**Acceptance log:** [acceptance_log.md](acceptance_log.md)
**Tools used:** Continue.dev + Gemini 2.5 Flash + Streamlit Community Cloud

### Features
- Fit score with rationale
- 4-axis bar chart breakdown
- Missing skills + free learning resources

### Reflection (3 lines)
- **Vibe vs engineered:** This is vibe-coded. To productionise, I would add caching, error handling on Gemini failures, rate limiting per user.
- **What Continue.dev did well:** scaffolded the Streamlit layout fast.
- **What I had to fix:** Continue.dev forgot to add the 4 sub-score fields to the Gemini prompt itself; I had to add them.

## Day 5 Lab 5B — Hugging Face Pulls

### Models tested
- `facebook/bart-large-mnli` — zero-shot classification
- `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` — sentiment

### Timing comparison

| | min | avg | Notes |
|---|-----|-----|-------|
| HF Inference API | 0.8s | 1.2s | Cold-start: 20s |
| Local in Colab | 2.1s | 3.4s | Download: 60s on first run |

### When to use each (3-line reflection)

1. **API:** for low-volume, occasional calls. Avoids download. Cold-start risk on first call after idle.
2. **Local:** for batch processing 100+ items, where you want predictable latency and don't pay per call.
3. **Production rule of thumb:** if your usage exceeds the API free tier (~30K requests/month at HF), self-host. Otherwise API.
